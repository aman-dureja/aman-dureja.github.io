      <p>Hello! My name is Aman, and I am a fourth year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have completed several internships throughout my undergraduate career.</p>
      <p>I am currently working as a Systems and Infrastructure Engineering Intern at <a href='https://engineering.linkedin.com' target='_blank'>LinkedIn</a>, building a high-throughput, low-latency, distributed graph database and query engine in C++. Previously, I worked on a distributed job system for big data workloads at <a href='https://apple.com' target='_blank'>Apple</a>, using Python and Go. I have also worked on core platforms at <a href='https://www.zynga.com/' target='_blank'>Zynga</a> and <a href='https://shopify.ca' target='_blank'>Shopify</a>. My main areas of interest reside around algorithms, concurrency, and large-scale distributed systems.</p>

<p>I am looking for new grad roles in 2020. For more information, please look at  my <a href="/resume.pdf" target="_blank">résumé</a>, and feel free to get in touch with me through <a href="mailto:aman@amandureja.com" target="_top">email</a> or <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/amandureja" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
