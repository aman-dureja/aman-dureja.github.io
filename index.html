    <p>Hello! My name is Aman, and I am a third year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have completed several internships, including working on core platforms at companies like <a href='https://apple.com' target='_blank'>Apple</a>, <a href='https://www.zynga.com/' target='_blank'>Zynga</a>, and <a href='https://shopify.ca'>Shopify</a>. My main areas of interest reside around concurrency, large-scale distributed systems, and optimizing code to make it as performant as possible.</p>

<p>I like to explore new technologies and build interesting programs in my spare time. Some of my notable projects include an <a href="https://github.com/aman-dureja/arm-cpu-emu" target="_blank">ARM CPU Emulator</a> written in OCaml, and a low-level, object-oriented HTTP <a href="https://github.com/aman-dureja/sock-serve" target="_blank">server toolkit</a> written in C++ using TCP sockets. You can view all my projects on <a href="https://github.com/aman-dureja" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I am currently open to internship opportunities for Fall 2019. Feel free to download my <a href="/resume.pdf" target="_blank">résumé</a>, and get in touch with me through <a href="mailto:aman@amandureja.com" target="_top">email</a> or <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/amandureja" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
